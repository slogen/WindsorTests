# WindsorTests

Contrains my experiments with windsor:

# Support for LifeTimeBoundTo for multiple items, which will bind the the type furthest away. Useful for types that are used both in services and web-sessions. Like DbContext
# Support for "automated" logging. A real implementation of a Log injection based on NLog (could probably be generalized)
